# Planet CRD for Kubernetes

## Terraforming planets using Kubernetes CRD

I'll prefix this by saying that I have not applied these yamls to a K8s cluster, as nothing would happen anyway.
This is just an interesting way (to me anyway) to try and quantify a planet in terms of object notation, and using Kubernetes CRD syntax as a platform for that.
